## ðŸ“¦ Project Releases & Compatibility  

I want to create **official releases** for this repository to ensure:  
- Easy usage without dependency issues.  
- Guaranteed compatibility with the latest Ubuntu ISO files.  
- A stable experience on new Ubuntu Desktop installations.  

Currently, I donâ€™t have a clear plan for managing releases, but I am actively working on it.  
Future updates will include a structured release system to improve usability and stability. ðŸš€
